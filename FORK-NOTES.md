I've forked the upstream repo at github.com/russross/blackfriday as I
only am interested in v2 implementation and want that to be tracked in
master instead of v1.5. The gopkg.in appears to be stale and referencing
the main repo and then having to sort out with tags and branch are current
is a pain. Eventualy I'll switch to gomarkdown but for now I'm forking.
